Along with Docker the course also teach concepts of CI and how to use AWS and Travis. There is a dedicated Kubernetes portion of the course, but it won't be covered by this documentation as of now.

## How it works
Most of the lectures involves following the teacher through a series of commands lines in the terminal. Other times it's required to code along with a code editor. Rarely the lesson will be on another webpage like AWS and the teacher will show how to setup some configurations. 

Most of the instructions are not required to be followed at all and the files are available to download.

To convey real world applications using Docker the course introduces small projects. These projects give a good idea of how DevOps operations and how integration between Travis, GitHub and AWS works. 
## Why use it
It's a good introduction to what is Docker and how to use. The lessons are brief, but efficient and they are challenging enough without feeling overwhelming. The series of project helps a lot in understanding the uses od Docker in real world applications.
