# Making This Documentation
Going around and learning new things is great, but there is no real value to it if we cannot apply it somehow. That being said, this portion of the documentation documents the process of creating this documentation page.

## Start Up
### __Learning__
We start from the very basic: researching. The very first thing done was going to [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) documentation page and learning what it was and the basics on how to use it. Quickly learning about MkDocs showed that I did not have a good understanding of what a static site generator was and neither what a static site was. So I started reading some blogs to find the answers like [here](https://techterms.com/definition/staticwebsite), [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page), [here](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/) and [here](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/pubapis_static_site_generators.html).

The next step was to learn a little more on static site generators and for that matter I started learning more about [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), a nice looking theme for MkDocs. 

The final step before trying any implementation was to learn how to host a static webpage. I ended learning about [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as it would allow a free and easily deployable way to host this documentation. The integration between Github Pages and GitHub was also a great factor.
